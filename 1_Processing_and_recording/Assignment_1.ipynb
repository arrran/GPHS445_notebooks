    "\n",
    "Outline:\tThe object of this assignment is to explore the relationship between the time and frequency domains using Matlab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlines:\tPlease complete all the questions and hand in your report and accompanying graphs that provide proof of the correctness of your answers by the deadline listed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grading:\tAll reports should be presented legibly, with attention to grammar and spelling, and all figures should be carefully labelled (include axes labels with units, and a figure number and title so you can refer to it).  A short summary and discussion should accompany the report.\n",

    "Simple signals — We will first experiment with basic Matlab functions, plotting, and Fourier analysis.  While logged onto one of the servers, start MATLAB to complete these exercises.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5 marks \n",
    "We are going to experiment with signals and frequency.  We will create a signal of the form [sin(4t)+0.2sin(16t)],where t is a time vector at a given sampling rate]and test the effects of sampling rate on our ability to analyse the frequency content of such signals.  We will do this for at least two sampling rates so you may wish to run the commands below in a small script so that it is easy to run with different sampling rates.  You do not have to submit the script as part of the assignment.  If you find it easier you can complete it all directly on the command line.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First create a time vector spanning the interval 0–2 seconds. It is easy to define a range of values at a regular interval in MATLAB.  There is an example below, but first choose a sampling rate.  Consider what frequencies are defined in the formula above.  (We will do this multiple times, so don’t spend too much time choosing.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a range of values to a variable MATLAB requires a beginning value followed by a colon ‘:’, then the spacing you want between the values (in this case the sampling rate) followed by another colon ‘:’, and finally the maximum value.  See the example below.  \n",
    ">>sampRate=1/x to define a sampling rate in terms of x samples per second (you will choose this—e.g., try x=30)\n",
    ">> times=0:sampRate:10;%create a vector of times at the chosen sampling rate \n",
    "\n",
    "What Nyquist frequency does this sampling interval correspond to?\n",
    "Next, create and plot a signal vector s according to the formula sin_sig=sin(4t)+0.2sin(16t):\n",
    "\n",
    ">> sin_sig=sin(4*pi*times)+0.2*sin(16*pi*times); %note the multiplication sign\n",
    ">>figure %create a new figure window for plotting\n",
    ">> plot(times,sin_sig);%create a plot of the sin signal (y-values) at the sampled times (times, x-values)\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the two frequencies we’ve used here?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Play with the axes commands to make the plot readable. Make sure to annotate this graph (and all following graphs) appropriately including axes labels with units and a title with a figure number.  Plots should mark sample locations (rather than just being lines). If you need help with this look at the commands listed at the end of this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s look at the spectrum of the signal we’ve created.  We need to do two things; first, compute the values of the Fourier transform, and second, plot the amplitude spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> freq_sig = fft(sin_sig);%take the fast fourier transform of the sin signal we created above\n",
    "\n",
    ">> freq_sig(1) = []; %Delete the first entry in freq_sig, which is equal to the sum of sin_sig\n",
    ">> lfreq = length(freq_sig);%calcualte the number of entries (length)in freq_sig\n",
    "\n",
    "%Note that the length command will return the size of the longest dimension of an array.  If you want to know the size of a specific dimension, use the size command.  \n",
    ">> half_lfreq=floor(lfreq/2); %floor rounds down to ensure that this is an integer.  If you want to round up you can use the matching command ceil, but for this excercise we need to round down.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To plot the amplitude spectrum for positive frequencies only (since the amplitude spectrum is the same for the positive and negative frequencies), we require a vector of frequencies ranging from 1/n to the Nyquist frequency: remember, the Nyquist frequency is calculated from the sampling rate.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> nyq = %put your calculated nyquist frequency here%; \n",
    "\n",
    ">> freq = (1:half_lfreq)/half_lfreq*nyq;\n",
    ">> posfreq = abs(freq_sig)/half_lfreq;%take the absolute value to only look at positive frequencies. And divide amplitudes by half_lfreq\n",
    "\n",
    ">> figure\n",
    ">> plot(freq,posfreq(1:half_lfreq));\n",
    "Then add labels to the figure\n",
    ">> xlabel (etc.)—or work with gui interface\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you notice about the amplitudes of the two frequencies… which one’s bigger?  Does this seem correct, given the equation you used to create s in the first place?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you recovered the frequencies you expected your sampling frequency was high enough to recover all the original frequencies.  Go back and repeat steps a-d at a lower sampling rate to see what happens.  If you did not recover the expected frequencies, your sampling rate was probably too low.  Repeat steps a-d with a higher sampling rate.  Think about what sampling we will need to correctly sample the highest frequencies in the signal and try again until you can recover the original frequencies.  You may wish to use the clear command to get rid of everything in your current workspace so that you’re sure you are using your new updated variables.  You will not be able to get your variables back or undo after using this command so be sure to save first if you want to use this workspace again later.  Your report should have a graph showing different sample-rates for the same signal.\n",

    "Create cosine waves with varying frequencies to see how close you can come to a delta function.  Again you may want to run these commands in a script rather than on the command line so that you can edit and vary them without retyping them again.  If using a script, remember you do not need to use the ‘>>’, that symbol is just indicating single commands for the command line in this text. MATLAB will automatically evaluate complete commands that appear on different lines of a script or that are separated by a semicolon (Try this to check it’s the same.) \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, try this:\n",
    ">> \n",
    ">> t=-2:1/100:2;\n",
    ">> cosvar(:,1)=cos(pi*t);\n",
    ">> cosvar(:,2)=cos(2*pi*t);\n",
    ">> cosvar(:,3)= cos(3*pi*t);\n",
    ">> cosvar(:,4)= cos(4*pi*t);\n",
    ">>cossum=sum(cosvar,2); % take sum along 2nd dimension (i.e. across/x)\n",
    ">>figure %figure calls a new figure window \n",
    ">>plot(t,cossum);\n",
    "\n",
    "Now calculate the Fourier amplitude spectrum of the sum.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Why can you or why can you not achieve a waveform that looks like a delta function with this method?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Try more terms to see how close you can get to a delta function.\n",

    "Now we’ll experiment with S wave data recorded at three sites in Porirua.\n",
    "Load the seismic data in the file porirua_data.mat and store it in a variable named pdata:\n",
    "\n",
    ">> pdata = load(‘porirua_data.mat’);  %This will load the Porirua data\n",
    ">>quake_data = pdata.quake_data; % get quake_data from pdata structure.\n",
    " \n",
    "The data matrix contains four columns: column 1 is the time data, and column 2–4 are the seismometer horizontal component data for stations PB8, PB5, and L18 at a rock site in Porirua, a sedimentary basin in Porirua, and a sedimentary basin in Naenae, respectively. \n",
    "What is the sample rate for this data?\n",
    "Plot each data series as a function of time using different colours or try plotting each waveform in a different subplot.  Here’s one way to do it using a loop:\n",
    "\n",
    ">> for ip=1:3\n",
    "\tsubplot(3,1,ip);\n",
    "\tplot(quake_data(:,1),quake_data(:,1+ip))\n",
    "   end\n",
    "\n",
    "Note in the above example I’ve used the variable ‘ip’ instead of a simple ‘i’.  MATLAB will allow you to assign a value to a variable named ‘i’, but it will also recognize it as ‘i’ in imaginary numbers so it is best to get in the habit of using other variable names.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Describe, as quantitatively as possible, any notable differences between the three waveforms.  What are the sampling intervals and Nyquist frequencies?\n",
    "Compute the Fourier transform of each waveform and plot (using subplot if you like) the three amplitude spectra, or the three corresponding power spectra.  You will only need to calculate the frequency vector once (we called it freq in the previous questions), since it will be the same for all three spectra.\n",
    "The data from PB5 and L18 were collected in sedimentary basins, which can shake like a bowl of jelly in response to seismic waves. A basin can resonate at particular frequencies just like a simple harmonic oscillator. The resonance continues long after the seismic energy has been attenuated at the nearby rock site. The frequency of oscillation for a simple cylindrical basin is related to the velocity of the material and the depth of the basin. A wave whose wavelength is four times the thickness of the basin will resonate in the basin.\n",
    "\n",
    "4  thickness = wavelength = velocity / frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "The surface shear wave velocity in Porirua has been measured at 110 m s–1, while in Naenae it is 80 m s–1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Estimate a thickness for each basin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we’ll filter the signals using various low-, high-, and bandpass filters.  The commands we’ll use to create and apply a filter are butter and filter.  Remember you can get help on any MATLAB commands by typing >>help command for any command or by searching for the command in the MATLAB help feature (blue/white question mark).  \n",
    "Choose a single earthquake seismogram to work with.  Tell us which one you chose.\n",
    "Here’s an example of creating and applying a lowpass filter to the PB8 data:\n",
    "\n",
    ">> [b_low,a_low] = butter(8,0.2);\n",
    ">> low = filter(b_low,a_low,quake_data(:,2));\n",
    "\n",
    "Here “8” is the order (complexity) of the filter, and “0.2” tells Matlab to use a cutoff frequency of 0.2 times the Nyquist frequency.  You’ll explore what the complexity does below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A highpass filter is created using, for example, the syntax\n",
    "\n",
    ">> [b_high,a_high] = butter(8,0.8,‘high’)\n",
    "\n",
    "and a bandpass filter using, for example\n",
    "\n",
    ">> [b_band,a_band] = butter(8,[0.2 0.4])\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment with creating and applying various filters to this waveform.  You can look at the frequency response of each filter in the form of a plot using the command:\n",
    "\n",
    ">> freqz(b_low,a_low) (etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the spectra of different filtered waveforms to the original spectra, and confirm that the filters are doing what you anticipated.\n",
    "What effect does increasing the order of the filter have on the signal (compare order 2 to order 4 and 8) ?  What phase effects does it have?  \n",
    "What effect does applying the same filter several times have?\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. 5 marks\n",
    "\tSeismic background noise\n",
    "Two sets of noise data should be in your directory: cottontest.mat and firthtest.mat.  They contain sets of noise recorded on broadband seismometers in two locations: cottontest was recorded at 80 samples/sec on the bottom floor of the Cotton building here at Vic.  Firthtest was recorded at 200 samples/sec at my (single-story) house in Firth Terrace, Karori.  Read in both sets of data and get Fourier transforms. The information for Firth and Cottontest is in the SAC headers in the SAC data structure. You should be able to find that the channels are 1 for Vertical, 2 for North and 3 for East.\n",
    "What are the dominant periods of the noise in the two locations?  Does your data seem to verify the “rule of thumb” that the natural period of a building is equal to 0.1 s * number of stories?  Can you see the “microseism” peak that is associated with waves?  What period and frequency does it correspond to?\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. 5 marks\n",
    "Seismometer response: Open the file ‘causal_instrument_corrections_final.zip’ and copy its content to your Matlab working directory. \n",

    ">> example_instrum_correct\t\n",
    "\n",
    "This will correct two earthquake traces for the instrument response of the two seismometers they were recorded on – a broadband seismometer and a short period seismometer. Describe the differences between the two corrected responses, and explain why the differences exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot the corrected and uncorrected waveforms and discuss the differences;\n",
    "Adapt the scripts to convert to either displacement or acceleration (hint, either add or remove a zero from the poles-and-zeros – if we haven’t covered this yet, ask the lecturer!). This didn’t work well\n"
